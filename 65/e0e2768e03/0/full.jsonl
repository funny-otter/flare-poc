After cg6, two tasks unblock: **sy5** (P1, generate keypair in constructor) and **5uh** (P2, add errors and event)\n\n\n3.

Let me think about this carefully.\n\nThe current logic is:\n```\nwithdrawalAmount = depositAmount - gasCost\n```\n\nWhere `gasCost = gasPrice * 21000` (the cost of a simple ETH transfer on Sepolia).\n\nThe idea is: the encumbered wallet on Sepolia holds the deposited ETH. When we want to withdraw, the encumbered wallet needs to send a transaction on Sepolia. But to send a transaction, it needs to pay gas. The gas comes from its own balance (the deposited ETH). So it can't send the full deposit amount — it needs to keep some for gas.\n\nWait, but the encumbered wallet doesn't have any ETH for gas on Sepolia! The deposit was sent TO the encumbered wallet address on Sepolia. So the encumbered wallet's Sepolia balance IS the deposit amount. When it sends a withdrawal tx, the gas comes from its own balance. So it can only send `deposit - gas`.\n\n\nThe user is asking why we subtract gas from the withdrawal amount, which gas specifically, and who pays for it. The answer is straightforward: the encumbered wallet on Sepolia holds the deposited ETH, and when it initiates the withdrawal transaction, it must pay the gas fee from that same balance, so the withdrawable amount is the deposit minus the gas cost for that transaction.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":179,"cache_read_input_tokens":76885,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":179},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4RPA4i3NQiSpyGesZYm","type":"assistant","uuid":"9423ae7a-6a84-4288-9dde-c105a06f1659","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:35:54.926Z"}

Here's what's happening:\n\nThe **encumbered wallet** is an address on Sepolia whose private key lives inside the Sapphire contract. When you deposit 0.0001 ETH, that ETH sits in the encumbered wallet's Sepolia balance.\n\nTo withdraw, the Sapphire contract signs a raw ETH transfer *from* the encumbered wallet *to* the user, and the relayer broadcasts it on Sepolia. That transaction costs **Sepolia gas**, and the encumbered wallet is the `tx.origin` — so **it pays the gas from its own balance** (the deposited ETH).\n\nSince its only funds are the deposit, it can't send the full amount — it needs to hold back enough to cover its own gas fee. Hence `deposit - (gasPrice * 21000)`.\n\nThis is a PoC simplification with some issues:\n- The gas price is estimated *before* broadcast, so it could be stale by the time the tx lands\n- The user loses value to Sepolia gas on every withdrawal\n- There's no way to top up the encumbered wallet's gas budget independently\n\nA production design would probably fund the encumbered wallet with a separate gas budget, or have the relayer sponsor gas via a paymaster/meta-tx pattern, so users get their full deposit back.

This allows intelligent merging (e.g., adding a scenario without copying the entire requirement).\n\n**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**\n\n   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.\n\n   Show changes that have delta specs (under `specs/` directory).\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.\n\n2. **Find delta specs**\n\n   Look for delta spec files in `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/*/spec.md`.\n\n   Each delta spec file contains sections like:\n   - `## ADDED Requirements` - New requirements to add\n   - `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changes to existing requirements\n   - `## REMOVED Requirements` - Requirements to remove\n   - `## RENAMED Requirements` - Requirements to rename (FROM:/TO: format)\n\n   If no delta specs found, inform user and stop.\n\n3. **For each delta spec, apply changes to main specs**\n\n   For each capability with a delta spec at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`:\n\n   a. **Read the delta spec** to understand the intended changes\n\n   b. **Read the main spec** at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (may not exist yet)\n\n   c. **Apply changes intelligently**:\n\n      **ADDED Requirements:**\n      - If requirement doesn't exist in main spec → add it\n      - If requirement already exists → update it to match (treat as implicit MODIFIED)\n\n      **MODIFIED Requirements:**\n      - Find the requirement in main spec\n      - Apply the changes - this can be:\n        - Adding new scenarios (don't need to copy existing ones)\n        - Modifying existing scenarios\n        - Changing the requirement description\n      - Preserve scenarios/content not mentioned in the delta\n\n      **REMOVED Requirements:**\n      - Remove the entire requirement block from main spec\n\n      **RENAMED Requirements:**\n      - Find the FROM requirement, rename to TO\n\n   d. **Create new main spec** if capability doesn't exist yet:\n      - Create `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`\n      - Add Purpose section (can be brief, mark as TBD)\n      - Add Requirements section with the ADDED requirements\n\n4. **Show summary**\n\n   After applying all changes, summarize:\n   - Which capabilities were updated\n   - What changes were made (requirements added/modified/removed/renamed)\n\n**Delta Spec Format Reference**\n\n```markdown\n## ADDED Requirements\n\n### Requirement: New Feature\nThe system SHALL do something new.\n\n#### Scenario: Basic case\n- **WHEN** user does X\n- **THEN** system does Y\n\n## MODIFIED Requirements\n\n### Requirement: Existing Feature\n#### Scenario: New scenario to add\n- **WHEN** user does A\n- **THEN** system does B\n\n## REMOVED Requirements\n\n### Requirement: Deprecated Feature\n\n## RENAMED Requirements\n\n- FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`\n- TO: `### Requirement: New Name`\n```\n\n**Key Principle: Intelligent Merging**\n\nUnlike programmatic merging, you can apply **partial updates**:\n- To add a scenario, just include that scenario under MODIFIED - don't copy existing scenarios\n- The delta represents *intent*, not a wholesale replacement\n- Use your judgment to merge changes sensibly\n\n**Output On Success**\n\n```\n## Specs Synced: <change-name>\n\nUpdated main specs:\n\n**<capability-1>**:\n- Added requirement: \"New Feature\"\n- Modified requirement: \"Existing Feature\" (added 1 scenario)\n\n**<capability-2>**:\n- Created new spec file\n- Added requirement: \"Another Feature\"\n\nMain specs are now updated. The change remains active - archive when implementation is complete.\n```\n\n**Guardrails**\n- Read both delta and main specs before making changes\n- Preserve existing content not mentioned in delta\n- If something is unclear, ask for clarification\n- Show what you're changing as you go\n- The operation should be idempotent - running twice should give same result\n\n\nARGUMENTS: fdc-encumbered-wallet"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"33b775a3-2d14-44aa-beb4-71ab31a423a4","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:44:06.368Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_014b3KowbjTWn4n2LqRe6Jnf"}

If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.\n\n**Steps**\n\n1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**\n\n   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.\n\n   Show only active changes (not already archived).\n   Include the schema used for each change if available.\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.\n\n2. **Check artifact completion status**\n\n   Run `openspec status --change \"<name>\" --json` to check artifact completion.\n\n   Parse the JSON to understand:\n   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used\n   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)\n\n   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**\n   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts\n   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed\n   - Proceed if user confirms\n\n3. **Check task completion status**\n\n   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.\n\n   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).\n\n   **If incomplete tasks found:**\n   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks\n   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed\n   - Proceed if user confirms\n\n   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.\n\n4. **Assess delta spec sync state**\n\n   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.\n\n   **If delta specs exist:**\n   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`\n   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)\n   - Show a combined summary before prompting\n\n   **Prompt options:**\n   - If changes needed: \"Sync now (recommended)\", \"Archive without syncing\"\n   - If already synced: \"Archive now\", \"Sync anyway\", \"Cancel\"\n\n   If user chooses sync, execute /opsx:sync logic (use the openspec-sync-specs skill). Proceed to archive regardless of choice.\n\n5. **Perform the archive**\n\n   Create the archive directory if it doesn't exist:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p openspec/changes/archive\n   ```\n\n   Generate target name using current date: `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`\n\n   **Check if target already exists:**\n   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date\n   - If no: Move the change directory to archive\n\n   ```bash\n   mv openspec/changes/<name> openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>\n   ```\n\n6. **Display summary**\n\n   Show archive completion summary including:\n   - Change name\n   - Schema that was used\n   - Archive location\n   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)\n   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)\n\n**Output On Success**\n\n```\n## Archive Complete\n\n**Change:** <change-name>\n**Schema:** <schema-name>\n**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/\n**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or \"No delta specs\" or \"Sync skipped\")\n\nAll artifacts complete. All tasks complete.\n```\n\n**Guardrails**\n- Always prompt for change selection if not provided\n- Use artifact graph (openspec status --json) for completion checking\n- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm\n- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)\n- Show clear summary of what happened\n- If sync is requested, use openspec-sync-specs approach (agent-driven)\n- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting\n\n\nARGUMENTS: fdc-encumbered-wallet"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"d6539dfb-2dfd-47f1-9b9d-d491b771f8a2","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:45:21.573Z","sourceToolUseID":"toolu_01C2wwGbnHJ1Ata978dGgtwx"}
