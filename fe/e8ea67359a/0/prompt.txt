the address should have funds now

chekc again

---

can you update the work flow that the account sends eth to itself on sepolia, tracks the tx hash und uses this?

---

use same fallback as with sapphire

yes

close epic and readme, add .beads to gitignore

---

can we implement the poc a bit more.
add creating a deposit address(encumbered wallet) like flexvaults-test does. deposit to this address. then in the end of the workflow create withdraw with tx to send out of the encumbered wallet back to the user

Base directory for this skill: /home/tom/dev/oasis/flare-poc/.claude/skills/openspec-new-change

Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

   Use the default schema (omit `--schema`) unless the user explicitly requests a different workflow.

   **Use a different schema only if the user mentions:**
   - A specific schema name → use `--schema <name>`
   - "show workflows" or "what workflows" → run `openspec schemas --json` and let them choose

   **Otherwise**: Omit `--schema` to use the default.

3. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   Add `--schema <name>` only if the user requested a specific workflow.
   This creates a scaffolded change at `openspec/changes/<name>/` with the selected schema.

4. **Show the artifact status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```
   This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema (e.g., `proposal` for spec-driven).
   Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   ```bash
   openspec instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   ```
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it, or ask me to continue."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow


ARGUMENTS: Add encumbered wallet (deposit address) and withdrawal signing to FdcAccounting. Generate a Sapphire keypair at deploy time using EthereumUtils.generateKeypair(), expose the deposit address, validate receivingAddress in creditDeposit, and add signWithdrawal that uses EIP155Signer to sign raw Sepolia withdrawal txs. Update accounting-demo.ts to deposit to the encumbered address and withdraw at the end.
